- 📜 **[TinyCryptoParser](./TinyCryptoParser.md)** — A lightweight serializer and deserializer for complex JavaScript data types, ensuring safe encryption, transmission, and storage across different environments.

- 📄 **[TinyCertCrypto](./TinyCertCrypto.md)** — A lightweight tool for managing RSA key pairs and X.509 certificates with support for generation, PEM parsing, encryption/decryption of JSON, and certificate metadata extraction. Works in both Node.js and browser environments (with limitations in browser).

- 📄 **[TinyOlm](./TinyOlm)** — A simple yet powerful encryption library for end-to-end communication using the Olm protocol. TinyOlm enables secure, privacy-preserving message exchange through identity keys, one-time keys, and session management in both Node.js and browser environments.
